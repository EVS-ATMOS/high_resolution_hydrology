\abstract{This paper describes a Department of Homeland Security, Regional Resiliency Assessment 
Program study into precipitation over Portland, Maine carried out by Argonne National Laboratory. The
 primary data source is scanning weather radar which collects information about precipitating particles
  over a large (250km plus) domain. The Python ARM radar Toolkit was used to retrieve rainfall rates 
  from the local radar (in the Gray township outside of Portland) and map them onto a 250m resolution
   grid over a 100km domain. Using Argonne's large scale cluster, Blues, the problem was mapped to 
   10 years worth of data, just over 600,000 ten minute volumes or just over 10TB of data. Each time 
   step was reduced to two numbers: The domain mean and maximum rainfall rate to allow easy 
   indexing of the data set. In addition the diurnal (daily) cycle of precipitation was studied as was the seasonal cycle. }

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Quoting directly from the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) webpage : \textit{The 
Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP) is a cooperative assessment of specific
 critical infrastructure within a designated geographic area and a regional analysis of the
surrounding infrastructure. The RRAP is led by the Department of Homeland Security
and addresses a range of hazards that could have regionally and nationally significant
 consequences. Each year, the Department selects these voluntary and non-regulatory 
RRAP projects with input and guidance from federal and state partners.} Argonne is a
partner in the RRAP project over Portland, Maine. One specific aspect we are looking
at in critical drainage infrastructure and what will be required in a changing climate
scenario. Dynamical downscaling (eg \cite{wang}) where a high resolution computer
 model is used to simulate what happens within the 100km climate model grid cell, 
 is coming into more common usage. However, the key science question being asked by
  Argonne researchers is: Is the 12km resolution of these models enough to resolve high intensity  
localized precipitation events?

To this end our team carried out a study that involves using NOAA weather radars, known as 
Weather Surveillance Radars -1988 Doppler or WSR-88D (\cite{crum_wsr-88d_1993}) to create high 
resolution rain maps for ingest into hydrological models. These rain maps are then de-resolved or made 
coarser and the impact on stream and culvert flow analyzed over the Portland area. This report only 
deals with the generation of the rain maps and is broken into four sections: This introduction, Background 
information on the tools used and an introduction to radar meteorology, a discussion of the results obtained 
and some thoughts as to future work.  

 
\section{Backround}
Data from the WSR-88D radars are freely available both realtime, archived by the National Centers for 
Environmental Information and also, recently in the Amazon Cloud. In order to help the reader understand
the processing that was performed on the radar data to extract geophysical insight we will first give some
basic background in radar meteorology. 

\subsection{NOAA weather radars}
\label{ssec:nexrad}
The National Weather Service operates a network of 160 radars for the monitoring of atmospheric phenomena. 
These transmit pluses of radiation and monitor the reflections, or backscatter, of objects in the pulse's path. The
 radar receives these reflected signals and calculates profiles of data along the path of propagation of the pulse. 
 If the radar stayed still users will receive just one "soda straw" view through the target of study (eg a rainstorm) 
 so, in order to map a volume of space the radar is scanned in azimuth (from north) and elevation (from the horizon).
 This is illustrated in part in fig \ref{fig:radar}. 
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{radar_prop.png}
    \caption{Cartoon of the propagation of the radar beam through a storm, By Vigneron et Pierre cb - Own work,

    \label{fig:radar}
\end{figure}

A single sweep through 360 degrees of azimuth is carried out before the elevation angle is changed. This is called a 
Plan Position Indicator scan or PPI (a historical hangover from when radar images were viewed on cathode ray tube 
displays). One primary measurement radars collect is how effectively the media (eg raindrops) reflects radiation back
 and is called Reflectivity Factor often denoted $\mathrm{Z_e}$. We will skip the derivation and description of this 
 quantity, interested readers are directed to \cite{doviak1984doppler} for more information. An example of a PPI of reflectivity factor is 
 shown in fig \ref{fig:z}. 

\begin{figure}[h]

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Data in the radars native coordinate system of azimuth and range from the lowest elevation sweep of 0.5$^\circ$. }
\end{figure}

If we assume that the volume of the radar pulse contains a number of rain droplets of varying diameter (D) and can be described 
as obeying a number distribution $\mathrm{N(D)}$ (so for a particular Diameter you get a density of rain drops in $\mathrm{m^{-3}}$ 
of N). The reflectivity of raindrops ends up being:
\begin{align*}
Z_e = \int{N(D)D^6dD}
\end{align*}
or the 6$\mathrm{^{th}}$ moment of the drop size distribution. This means a small number of larger drops has a bigger
 impact than increasing the density of smaller drops. 
 
 There have been many papers written on the best way to derive rainfall rates from reflectivity factor and other radar variables. 
 For the purposes of this study where we are more interested in the comparative nature of rainfall patterns we stuck to a simple 
 parametric fit as presented in \cite{gu_polarimetric_2011} of
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:zr}
 Z_e=300R^{1.4}.
 \end{equation}
Equation is inverted to give rainfall rate and an example of this is shown in fig \ref{fig:rainfall}.

\subsection{Application chain}
\label{sec:ac}
The Python-ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART, \cite{heistermann_emergence_2014})  is the main
tool used to perform the steps of: Reading, retrieving rainfall rate, gridding to a 
cartesian grid and writing to a Community standard file format. 
Py-ART is a community data-model drive architecture for interactive development
 of custom processing chains implemented in the Python programming 
language and makes heavy use of the Scientific Python ecosystem (\cite{scipy}). 
Py-ART is community based open source software welcoming
 public contributions on \href{https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart}{GitHub}.

Py-ART has a native reader for multiple WSR-88D file formats. The data is read 
into the Py-ART common data model. Rainfall rate in native (antenna) coordinates
of range from the radar, azimuth from north and elevation above the horizon is
 calculated. Then, in order to facilitate easy analysis, the rainfall (in addition to other values) 
is mapped to a regular Cartesian grid with coordinates of meridional and zonal 
(east/west, north/south) displacement from the radar location. Mapping is 
achieved using an inverse distance weighted objective analysis system. Each grid point in the
 destination grid is assigned a radius of influence. Radar gates falling within that radius are 
 averaged to that point using a exponential inverse distance weighting (after \cite{barnes_technique_1964}).
  Py-ART calculates the optimal variable radius of influence. 

Since the radar samples azimuthally the resolution, $R$, of the data 
varies as a function of distance given by

\begin{equation}
R = 2d\tan(\frac{1}{2}\theta_{fwhm})
\end{equation}

where $\theta_{fwhm}$ is the radar beam width and $d$ is the distance of the range gate from the radar. 
The WSR-88D radars have a beam width of 1 degree so at a distance of 30km the resolution will be approximately
 500m. Given we wish to oversample near the city of Portland which is approximately 20km from the radar we chose
 a grid spacing of 200m resulting in a grid with 501 by 501 elements and a domain of 100km. 

 \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{mapped.png}
    \caption{Rainfall rates as shown in fig \ref{fig:rainfall} mapped to a Cartesian grid around the Portland, Maine area.}
    \label{fig:mapped}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mapped} shows a mapping of rainfall rates calculated in fig \ref{fig:rainfall}. This data is then saved to a NetCDF file that complies 
with the Climate Forecasting conventions (see http://cfconventions.org/).


\subsection{Data informatics}
Section \ref{sec:ac} gave an overview of the application chain for one volume. Given that our data set consists of hundreds of thousands of files 
we need an effective way to reduce the problem and map to a large scale cluster. Fortunately, due to the granularity (one granule = one file = one volume) 
the problem is \textit{pleasantly} parallel. Also fortunately the Scientific Python ecosystem has recently been enhanced by project Jupyter (\cite{jupyter})
which includes methods for simply mapping a serialized problem to a list of parameters (eg a file list) as shown in fig \ref{fig:cluster}. 
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{cluster.png}
    \caption{pictorial representation of a Jupyter cluster being used for Map-Reduce.  }
    \label{fig:cluster}
\end{figure}

Files containing data from the Portland WSR-88D (Code: KGYX) were staged to Argonne's Blues cluster with 310 compute nodes, 
64 GB of memory on each node, 16 cores per compute node (Intel Sandy Bridge) 4,960 compute cores available and a theoretical
 peak performance of 107.8 TFlops. Mapping the 670,353 files that made up the study was performed using several jobs ranging from
 64 to 1024 cores taking a wall time of just over 48 hours. Each job produced three output files: a NetCDF file containing the gridded data,
 plots such as those shown in fig \ref{fig:mapped} and a simple ascii file with the mean of the rainfall values in the domain and the 
 maximum value in the domain.
